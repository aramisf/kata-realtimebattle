# RealTimeBattle-Bot in Elixir

This is a template for a bot for RealTimeBattleBot (http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/) written in Elixir.

Use a fork of this repo to develop your own bot so we can have a nice tournament later.

Program your bot in this file `lib/your_bot.ex`.

Start the whole thing with `make start`.

The workaround for this is to use a Ubuntu 14.04 Docker container, in which this project in mounted at `/home/developer/bot`.
